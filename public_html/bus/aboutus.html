		<p>		
			PathPair is a website developed by students, for students. After two long summers, along with hard work and dedication, Moore Forward was able to create PathPair. Bringing committed students closer to the job fields that they desire.

		<img src="images/Boys.jpg" alt="Boys" height: "200" width="200" ALIGN="right"> Supervised by Kelly Cameron, the Executive Director of Moore Forward; high school students Nick Mihalovich, Cooper Wrona, John Hicks, and Adrianna Ballard were able to work diligently to create this program to assist students like them secure success for their future.

	Wanting nothing but the best, these students were hand picked by Kelly Cameron as well as other members of Moore Forward to ensure success for the PathPair Website.

	Nick Mihalovich, a rising Junior at Union Pines High School served as the computer programmer. Within the first week of having Nick aboard we knew that he was going to be a valuable asset to the team. Assisting Nick with the programming of the PathPair website was John Hicks, an undergraduate student attending UNCP, majoring in mass communications with a focus in broadcasting. <br>
	During the previous summer Jackson Taylor, a rising senior at Union Pines High School, assisted John Hicks as a computer programmer. Cooper Wrona, also a rising senior at Union Pines High School, has been aboard the creation of PathPair since the beginning. Cooper is well versed in many of the tasks that were needed upon the completion of PathPair such as graphic design, programming, along with assisting the other students with their jobs. Recent graduate of Pinecrest High School, Adrianna Ballard, was responsible for the design portion of the website. Although each student had skills that were essential to their designated task, the creation of PathPair was a collaborative effort that would not have been possible without all those present.</p>
